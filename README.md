# Data-Analysis-for-Hospitals

This Python project focuses on data analysis and visualization using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. It takes multiple CSV files containing medical data, processes, analyzes, and visualizes the data to derive valuable insights.

Key Features:
- **Data Integration**: Combines data from multiple CSV files (`general.csv`, `prenatal.csv`, `sports.csv`) into a single dataframe.
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardizes column names and performs data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and renaming categories.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducts statistical analysis on the data, including summarizing hospital-related statistics and age distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib to create histograms, pie charts, and violin plots for visualizing age distribution, diagnosis frequency, and height distribution.
- **Insightful Results**: Provides answers to specific medical questions based on the analyzed data, offering insights into the dataset.
